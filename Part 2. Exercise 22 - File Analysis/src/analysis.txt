Danes are seen by themselves as laid-back – no state-run alcohol shops, freedom to drink at seven in the morning. 
Norway views them as the comfortable people – the Danes have time to do everything, no stress, whereas the Swedes see Denmark as lacking in self-control when it comes to drinking and such things. 
Sweden is also well aware that Denmark has Little Brother syndrome about being the smallest of the three countries, so makes sure to hand out an appropriate amount of loving teasing so that Denmark stays just a teeny bit miffed.
